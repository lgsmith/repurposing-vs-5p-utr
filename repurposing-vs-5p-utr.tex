\section{Introduction}

Many of the most important messages in biology and disease have structurally conserved 5\sprime\ untranslated regions (\fputr) that carry out a myriad of functionally essential interactions to tune transcript output.

Perturbation of this output often has disease relevance.

Thus, these interactions constitute an attack surface, and finding binders modulating these complexes is likely to modulate the \fputr's function, and therefore disease biology.

Repurposing is helpful in this context because, with an abundance of potentially relevant targets, having a smaller library of molecules with inherent commercial salience increases the feasibility of screening many such targets.(Arjun)

% Don't worry about this sentence. It's only in here because I wanted to test the references typesetter.
Ensemble docking is possible versus clustered structures from simulations \citep{bowman2024}.

\section{Structured and conserved \fputr UTRs are an underexploited attack surface for many diseases}

Conceptually, there are at least five types of interactions present in functional \fputr s that could be modulated by noncovalent binders---of these, targeting binders to the RNP interface or interaction sites on the RNA itself are most appealing.

These types of targetable interactions exist in messages of key oncogens with highly conserved 5′UTR-structures such as C-JUN.

RNA and RNA-protein interaction sites also exist in viral RNAs, such as the \fputr of EV71.

\section{There is evidence that FDA approved molecules bind to RNAs and modulate RNA-protein complexes}

There are several known examples of RNP off-targets in the literature.

There are many molecules similar to known RNA binders in approved-molecule libraries.

There are many molecules with physiologically relevant side effects that have unknown off-targets.

Previous research has shown that off-target bidning of small molecules to RNA in RNPs can effect cellular function.

\section{There is a path to virtually screening many potential targets within a \fputr of interest}

Considering the \fputr of EV71 as a representative example, we can identify XXX targetable RNA elements, and YYY RNP complexes.

We can build models of these complexes using RNA-composer, and potentially other models that combine proteins and RNAs.
To perform a virtual screen, we’d first run simulations of these complexes looking for pockets or other interfaces. (Vas)

Docking would then be performed versus the ensembles that exhibit pockets using the Broad database, and using popshift to aggregate the docking results.

Validation using biophysical tools such as: NMR chemical shift perturbations, DSF, and ITC would help move repurposed hits toward leads in an alternative therapy. (Barrington)

%All financial, commercial or other relationships that might be perceived by the academic community as representing a potential conflict of interest must be disclosed. If no such relationship exists, authors will be asked to confirm the following statement: 

The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.

\section*{Author Contributions}

The Author Contributions section is mandatory for all articles, including articles by sole authors. If an appropriate statement is not provided on submission, a standard one will be inserted during the production process. The Author Contributions statement must describe the contributions of individual authors referred to by their initials and, in doing so, all authors agree to be accountable for the content of the work.

\section*{Funding}
Details of all funding sources should be provided, including grant numbers if applicable. Please ensure to add all necessary funding information, as after publication this is no longer possible.

\section*{Acknowledgments}
This is a short text to acknowledge the contributions of specific colleagues, institutions, or agencies that aided the efforts of the authors.

\section*{Supplemental Data}
 \href{http://home.frontiersin.org/about/author-guidelines#SupplementaryMaterial}{Supplementary Material} should be uploaded separately on submission, if there are Supplementary Figures, please include the caption in the same file as the figure.

Pockets are identified with a series of simple operations on a cubic grid. Using a set of receptor--ligand complexes we show that LIGSITE is able to identify the binding sites of small molecule ligands with high precision. The main advantage of LIGSITE is its speed. Typical search times are in the range of 5 to 20 s for medium-sized proteins. LIGSITE is therefore well suited for identification of pockets in large sets of proteins (e.g., protein families) for comparative studies. For graphical display LIGSITE produces VRML representations of the protein--ligand complex and the binding site for display with a VRML viewer such as WebSpace from SGI.},

  abstract = {The human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) genome contains multiple, highly conserved structural RNA domains that play key roles in essential viral processes. Interference with the function of these RNA domains either by disrupting their structures or by blocking their interaction with viral or cellular factors may seriously compromise HIV-1 viability. RNA aptamers are amongst the most promising synthetic molecules able to interact with structural domains of viral genomes. However, aptamer shortening up to their minimal active domain is usually necessary for scaling up production, what requires very time-consuming, trial-and-error approaches. Here we report on the in vitro selection of 64 nt-long specific aptamers against the complete 5{$\prime$}-untranslated region of HIV-1 genome, which inhibit more than 75\% of HIV-1 production in a human cell line. The analysis of the selected sequences and structures allowed for the identification of a highly conserved 16 nt-long stem-loop motif containing a common 8 nt-long apical loop. Based on this result, an in silico designed 16 nt-long RNA aptamer, termed RNApt16, was synthesized, with sequence 5{$\prime$}-CCCCGGCAAGGAGGGG-3{$\prime$}. The HIV-1 inhibition efficiency of such an aptamer was close to 85\%, thus constituting the shortest RNA molecule so far described that efficiently interferes with HIV-1 replication.},

Here, we present PocketMiner, a graph neural network trained to predict where pockets are likely to open in molecular dynamics simulations. Applying PocketMiner to single structures from a newly curated dataset of 39 experimentally confirmed cryptic pockets demonstrates that it accurately identifies cryptic pockets (ROC-AUC: 0.87) {$>$}1,000-fold faster than existing methods. We apply PocketMiner across the human proteome and show that predicted pockets open in simulations, suggesting that over half of proteins thought to lack pockets based on available structures likely contain cryptic pockets, vastly expanding the potentially druggable proteome.},

  abstract = {Obtaining accurate binding free energies from in silico screens has been a long-standing goal for the computational chemistry community. However, accuracy and computational cost are at odds with one another, limiting the utility of methods that perform this type of calculation. Many methods achieve massive scale by explicitly or implicitly assuming that the target protein adopts a single structure, or undergoes limited fluctuations around that structure, to minimize computational cost. Others simulate each protein--ligand complex of interest, accepting lower throughput in exchange for better predictions of binding affinities. Here, we present the PopShift framework for accounting for the ensemble of structures a protein adopts and their relative probabilities. Protein degrees of freedom are enumerated once, and then arbitrarily many molecules can be screened against this ensemble. Specifically, we use Markov state models (MSMs) as a compressed representation of a protein's thermodynamic ensemble. We start with a ligand-free MSM and then calculate how addition of a ligand shifts the populations of each protein conformational state based on the strength of the interaction between that protein conformation and the ligand. In this work we use docking to estimate the affinity between a given protein structure and ligand, but any estimator of binding affinities could be used in the PopShift framework. We test PopShift on the classic benchmark pocket T4 Lysozyme L99A. We find that PopShift is more accurate than common strategies, such as docking to a single structure and traditional ensemble docking-producing results that compare favorably with alchemical binding free energy calculations in terms of RMSE but not correlation-and may have a more favorable computational cost profile in some applications. In addition to predicting binding free energies and ligand poses, PopShift also provides insight into how the probability of different protein structures is shifted upon addition of various concentrations of ligand, providing a platform for predicting affinities and allosteric effects of ligand binding. Therefore, we expect PopShift will be valuable for hit finding and for providing insight into phenomena like allostery.},

  abstract = {Translation of the full-length messenger RNA (mRNA) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) generates the precursor of the viral enzymes via a programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift. Here, using dual-luciferase reporters, we investigated whether the highly structured 5{$\prime$} untranslated region (UTR) of this mRNA, which interferes with translation initiation, can modulate HIV-1 frameshift efficiency. We showed that, when the 5{$\prime$} UTR of HIV-1 mRNA occupies the 5{$\prime$} end of the reporter mRNA, HIV-1 frameshift efficiency is increased about fourfold in Jurkat T-cells, compared with a control dual-luciferase reporter with a short unstructured 5{$\prime$} UTR. This increase was related to an interference with cap-dependent translation initiation by the TAR-Poly(A) region at the 5{$\prime$} end of the messenger. HIV-1 mRNA 5{$\prime$} UTR also contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), but we showed that, when the cap-dependent initiation mode is available, the IRES is not used or is weakly used. However, when the ribosomes have to use the IRES to translate the dual-luciferase reporter, the frameshift efficiency is comparable to that of the control dual-luciferase reporter. The decrease in cap-dependent initiation and the accompanying increase in frameshift efficiency caused by the 5{$\prime$} UTR of HIV-1 mRNA is antagonized, in a dose-dependent way, by the Tat viral protein. Tat also stimulates the IRES-dependent initiation and decreases the corresponding frameshift efficiency. A model is presented that accounts for the variations in frameshift efficiency depending on the 5{$\prime$} UTR and the presence of Tat, and it is proposed that a range of frameshift efficiencies is compatible with the virus replication.},

  abstract = {Introduction: HIV-1 uses a programmed --1 ribosomal frameshift to generate Gag-Pol, the precursor of its enzymes, when its full-length mRNA is translated by the ribosomes of the infected cells. This change in the reading frame occurs at a so-called slippery sequence that is followed by a specific secondary structure, the frameshift stimulatory signal. This signal controls the frameshift efficiency. The synthesis of HIV-1 enzymes is critical for virus replication and therefore, the --1 ribosomal frameshift could be the target of novel antiviral drugs. Areas covered: Various approaches were used to select drugs interfering with the --1 frameshift of HIV-1. These include the selection and modification of chemical compounds that specifically bind to the frameshift stimulatory signal, the use of antisense oligonucleotides targeting this signal and the selection of compounds that modulate HIV-1 frameshift, by using bicistronic reporters where the expression of the second cistron depends upon HIV-1 frameshift. Expert opinion: The most promising approach is the selection and modification of compounds specifically targeting the HIV-1 frameshift stimulatory signal. The use of antisense oligonucleotides binding to the frameshift stimulatory signal is still questionable. The use of bicistronic reporters preferentially selects compounds that modulate the frameshift by targeting the ribosomes, which is less promising.},

Many RNA-binding proteins possess multiple RNA-binding domains; however, how these domains interplay to select and regulate RNA targets remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate three multi-domain proteins, Musashi-1, Musashi-2, and unkempt, which share a high degree of RNA specificity, a common feature across RNA-binding proteins. We used massively parallel \emph{in vitro} assays with unprecedented depth with random or naturally-derived RNA sequences and find that individual domains within a protein can have differing affinities, specificities, and motif spacing preferences. We conducted large scale competition assays between these proteins and determined how individual protein specificities and affinities influence competitive binding. Integration of binding and regulation \emph{in cells} with \emph{in vitro} specificities showed that target selection involves a combination of the protein intrinsic specificities described here, but cellular context is critical to drive these proteins to motifs in specific transcript regions. Finally, evolutionarily conserved RNA regions displayed evidence of binding multiple RBPs \emph{in cultured cells}, and these RNA regions represent the highest affinity targets. This work emphasizes the importance of \emph{in vitro} and \emph{in cultured cells} studies to fully profile RNA-binding proteins and highlights the complex modes of RNA-protein interactions and the contributing factors in target selection.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In 2017, we curated the RNA-targeted BIoactive ligaNd Database (R-BIND) and discovered distinguishing physicochemical properties of RNA-targeting ligands, leading us to propose the existence of an ``RNA-privileged'' chemical space. Biennial updates of the database and the establishment of a website platform (rbind.chem.duke.edu) have provided new insights and tools to design small molecules based on the analyzed physicochemical and spatial properties. In this report and R-BIND 2.0 update, we refined the curation approach and ligand classification system as well as conducted analyses of RNA structure elements for the first time to identify new targeting strategies. Specifically, we curated and analyzed RNA target structural motifs to determine the properties of small molecules that may confer selectivity for distinct RNA secondary and tertiary structures. Additionally, we collected sequences of target structures and incorporated an RNA structure search algorithm into the website that outputs small molecules targeting similar motifs without a priori secondary structure knowledge. Cheminformatic analyses revealed that, despite the 50\% increase in small molecule library size, the distinguishing properties of R-BIND ligands remained significantly different from that of proteins and are therefore still relevant to RNA-targeted probe discovery. Combined, we expect these novel insights and website features to enable the rational design of RNA-targeted ligands and to serve as a resource and inspiration for a variety of scientists interested in RNA targeting.},

At present, AlphaFold3 falls short in reliably predicting RNA and protein-RNA complex structures, particularly for non-canonical interactions where training data remain scarce. As a result, users should exercise caution when using AlphaFold3 predictions as hypotheses generators for RNA and protein-RNA complex structures. In the interim, integrating AI-based predictors with data-driven docking tools is recommended to address these limitations. This approach can help bridge the gap until sufficient training data are available to enable the development of more reliable predictive algorithms.},

The new AlphaFold model demonstrates substantially improved accuracy over many previous specialized tools: far greater accuracy for protein--ligand interactions compared with state-of-the-art docking tools, much higher accuracy for protein--nucleic acid interactions compared with nucleic-acid-specific predictors and substantially higher antibody--antigen prediction accuracy compared with AlphaFold-Multimer v.2.37,8.

Short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) based on two targets in the 5{$\prime$} end of the untranslated region and one in the rev gene flanked with 5{$\prime$} and 3{$\prime$} microRNA 30 (miR30) sequences were synthesized and placed under the control of an HIV promoter for Tat-mediated expression. HIV permissive cells were transduced with foamy virus vectors containing each hybrid shRNA expression cassette and tested for their efficacy on the inhibition of HIV replication. Effective Tat dependent expression of the shRNAs, as well as GFP placed downstream each shRNA was evident. In addition the results show inhibition of HIV replication by greater than 98\%. Interestingly, transduction of cells with a vector lacking an shRNA also revealed GFP expression in the presence of Tat with similar levels of inhibition of virus replication. When the TAR region was removed from this vector there was neither reduction in virus replication nor Tat-induced GFP expression. These results suggest that TAR in the vector, which Tat interacts to promote expression of the shRNA, is a potent inhibitor of virus replication. Previous studies with TAR regulated expression of antiviral genes ignore the contribution of TAR in the repression of virus replication. Interpretation of effective inhibition of HIV replication by antiviral genes located downstream of TAR while neglecting the efficacy of a potent repression by TAR is misleading.},

  abstract = {Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) is a robust computational method for simultaneous unconstrained enhanced sampling and free energy calculations of biomolecules. It works by adding a harmonic boost potential to smooth biomolecular potential energy surface and reduce energy barriers. GaMD greatly accelerates biomolecular simulations by orders of magnitude. Without the need to set predefined reaction coordinates or collective variables, GaMD provides unconstrained enhanced sampling and is advantageous for simulating complex biological processes. The GaMD boost potential exhibits a Gaussian distribution, thereby allowing for energetic reweighting via cumulant expansion to the second order (i.e., ``Gaussian approximation''). This leads to accurate reconstruction of free energy landscapes of biomolecules. Hybrid schemes with other enhanced sampling methods, such as the replica-exchange GaMD (rex-GaMD) and replica-exchange umbrella sampling GaMD (GaREUS), have also been introduced, further improving sampling and free energy calculations. Recently, new ``selective GaMD'' algorithms including the Ligand GaMD (LiGaMD) and Peptide GaMD (Pep-GaMD) enabled microsecond simulations to capture repetitive dissociation and binding of small-molecule ligands and highly flexible peptides. The simulations then allowed highly efficient quantitative characterization of the ligand/peptide binding thermodynamics and kinetics. Taken together, GaMD and its innovative variants are applicable to simulate a wide variety of biomolecular dynamics, including protein folding, conformational changes and allostery, ligand binding, peptide binding, protein--protein/nucleic acid/carbohydrate interactions, and carbohydrate/nucleic acid interactions. In this review, we present principles of the GaMD algorithms and recent applications in biomolecular simulations and drug design.

Understanding the molecular mechanism of viral replication is crucial for the development of antiviral drugs. The synthesis of viral polyproteins is a crucial step in viral progression. The synthesis of viral polyproteins in coronaviruses is regulated by the 5'-untranslated region (UTR); however, the detailed regulatory mechanism needs further investigation. The present study demonstrated that the RNA binding protein, RBM24, interacts with the RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 via its RNA recognition submotifs (RNPs). The findings revealed that RBM24 recognizes and binds to the GUGUG element at stem-loop 4 (SL4) in the 5'-UTR of SARS-CoV-2. The interaction between RBM24 and 5'-UTR prevents 80S ribosome assembly, which in turn inhibits polyproteins translation and the replication of SARS-CoV-2. Notably, other RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Ebolavirus, rhinovirus, West Nile virus, Zika virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, yellow fever virus, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus-1 also contain one or several G(U/C/A)GUG sequences in the 5'-UTR, which is also targeted by RBM24. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that RBM24 functions by interacting with the 5'-UTR of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and elucidated that RBM24 could be a host restriction factor for SARS-CoV-2 and other RNA viruses.},

From intracellular viral RNA-host interfaces to interactions between the RNA genome and structural proteins in virus particles themselves, almost the entire viral lifecycle is accompanied by a myriad of RNA--protein interactions that are required to fulfill their replicative potential. It is therefore important to characterize such rich and dynamic collections of viral RNA--protein interactions to understand virus evolution and their adaptation to their hosts and environment. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have allowed the characterization of viral RNA--protein interactions, including both transient and conserved interactions, where molecular and structural approaches have fallen short. In this review, we will provide a methodological overview of the high-throughput techniques used to study viral RNA--protein interactions, their biochemical mechanisms, and how they evolved from classical methods as well as one another. We will discuss how different techniques have fueled virus research to characterize how viral RNA and proteins interact, both locally and on a global scale.

After screening an RNA-biased library using a peptide-displacement assay, we identify DMA-135 as a dose-dependent inhibitor of viral translation and replication with no significant toxicity in cell-based studies. Structural, biophysical, and biochemical characterization support an allosteric mechanism in which DMA-135 induces a conformational change in the RNA structure that stabilizes a ternary complex with the AUF1 protein, thus repressing translation. This mechanism is supported by pull-down experiments in cell culture. These detailed studies establish enterovirus RNA structures as promising drug targets while revealing an approach and mechanism of action that should be broadly applicable to functional RNA targeting.},

  abstract = {The ongoing COVID-19/Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has become a significant threat to public health and has hugely impacted societies globally. Targeting conserved SARS-CoV-2 RNA structures and sequences essential for viral genome translation is a novel approach to inhibit viral infection and progression. This new pharmacological modality compasses two classes of RNA-targeting molecules: (1) synthetic small molecules that recognize secondary or tertiary RNA structures and (2) antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that recognize the RNA primary sequence. These molecules can also serve as a ``bait'' fragment in RNA degrading chimeras to eliminate the viral RNA genome. This new type of chimeric RNA degrader is recently named ribonuclease targeting chimera or RIBOTAC. This review paper summarizes the sequence conservation in SARS-CoV-2 and the current development of RNA-targeting molecules to combat this virus. These RNA-binding molecules will also serve as an emerging class of antiviral drug candidates that might pivot to address future viral outbreaks.},

  abstract = {RNAs are critical regulators of gene expression, and their functions are often mediated by complex secondary and tertiary structures. Structured regions in RNA can selectively interact with small molecules---via well-defined ligand-binding pockets---to modulate the regulatory repertoire of an RNA. The broad potential to modulate biological function intentionally via RNA--ligand interactions remains unrealized, however, due to challenges in identifying compact RNA motifs with the ability to bind ligands with good physicochemical properties (often termed drug-like). Here, we devise fpocketR, a computational strategy that accurately detects pockets capable of binding drug-like ligands in RNA structures. Remarkably few, roughly 50, of such pockets have ever been visualized. We experimentally confirmed the ligandability of novel pockets detected with fpocketR using a fragment-based approach introduced here, Frag-MaP, that detects ligand-binding sites in cells. Analysis of pockets detected by fpocketR and validated by Frag-MaP reveals dozens of sites able to bind drug-like ligands, supports a model for RNA secondary structural motifs able to bind quality ligands, and creates a broad framework for understanding the RNA ligand-ome.},

  abstract = {RNA motifs can be defined broadly as recurrent structural elements containing multiple intramolecular RNA--RNA interactions, as observed in atomic-resolution RNA structures. They constitute the modular building blocks of RNA architecture, which is organized hierarchically. Recent work has focused on analyzing RNA backbone conformations to identify, define and search for new instances of recurrent motifs in X-ray structures. One current view asserts that recurrent RNA strand segments with characteristic backbone configurations qualify as independent motifs. Other considerations indicate that, to characterize modular motifs, one must take into account the larger structural context of such strand segments. This follows the biologically relevant motivation, which is to identify RNA structural characteristics that are subject to sequence constraints and that thus relate RNA architectures to sequences.},

  abstract = {Protein--RNA interactions have crucial roles in various cellular activities, which, when dysregulated, can lead to a range of human diseases. The identification of small molecules that target the interaction between RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and RNA is progressing rapidly and represents a novel strategy for the discovery of chemical probes that facilitate understanding of the cellular functions of RBPs and of therapeutic agents with new mechanisms of action. In this Review, I present a current overview of targeting emerging RBPs using small-molecule inhibitors and recent progress in this burgeoning field. Small-molecule inhibitors that were reported for three representative emerging classes of RBPs, the microRNA-binding protein LIN28, the single-stranded or double-stranded RNA-binding Toll-like receptors and the CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins, are highlighted from a medicinal-chemistry and chemical-biology perspective. However, although this field is burgeoning, challenges remain in the discovery and characterization of small-molecule inhibitors of RBPs.},

  abstract = {Many proteins regulate the expression of genes by binding to specific regions encoded in the genome1. Here we introduce a new data set of RNA elements in the human genome that are recognized by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), generated as part of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project phase III. This class of regulatory elements functions only when transcribed into RNA, as they serve as the binding sites for RBPs that control post-transcriptional processes such as splicing, cleavage and polyadenylation, and the editing, localization, stability and translation of mRNAs. We describe the mapping and characterization of RNA elements recognized by a large collection of human RBPs in K562 and HepG2 cells. Integrative analyses using five assays identify RBP binding sites on RNA and chromatin in vivo, the in vitro binding preferences of RBPs, the function of RBP binding sites and the subcellular localization of RBPs, producing 1,223 replicated data sets for 356 RBPs. We describe the spectrum of RBP binding throughout the transcriptome and the connections between these interactions and various aspects of RNA biology, including RNA stability, splicing regulation and RNA localization. These data expand the catalogue of functional elements encoded in the human genome by the addition of a large set of elements that function at the RNA level by interacting with RBPs.},

The structures and mechanisms that RBPs use to bind and regulate RNA are incredibly diverse. In this review, we take a look at the components of protein-RNA interaction, from the molecular level to multi-component interaction. We first summarize what is known about protein-RNA molecular interactions based on analyses of solved structures. We additionally describe software currently available for predicting protein-RNA interaction and other resources useful for the study of RBPs. We then review the structure and function of seventeen known RNA-binding domains and analyze the hydrogen bonds adopted by protein-RNA structures on a domain-by-domain basis. We conclude with a summary of the higher-level mechanisms that regulate protein-RNA interactions.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 RNA structure and their functional relevance are largely unknown. Here we develop a simplified SPLASH assay and comprehensively map the in vivo RNA-RNA interactome of SARS-CoV-2 genome across viral life cycle. We report canonical and alternative structures including 5{$\prime$}-UTR and 3{$\prime$}-UTR, frameshifting element (FSE) pseudoknot and genome cyclization in both cells and virions. We provide direct evidence of interactions between Transcription Regulating Sequences, which facilitate discontinuous transcription. In addition, we reveal alternative short and long distance arches around FSE. More importantly, we find that within virions, while SARS-CoV-2 genome RNA undergoes intensive compaction, genome domains remain stable but with strengthened demarcation of local domains and weakened global cyclization. Taken together, our analysis reveals the structural basis for the regulation of replication, discontinuous transcription and translational frameshifting, the alternative conformations and the maintenance of global genome organization during the whole life cycle of SARS-CoV-2, which we anticipate will help develop better antiviral strategies.},

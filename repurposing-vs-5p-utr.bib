   abstract = {<p>Dead End (DND1) is an RNA-binding protein essential for germline development through its role in post-transcriptional gene regulation. The molecular mechanisms behind selection and regulation of its targets are unknown. Here, we present the solution structure of DND1’s tandem RNA Recognition Motifs (RRMs) bound to AU-rich RNA. The structure reveals how an NYAYUNN element is specifically recognized, reconciling seemingly contradictory sequence motifs discovered in recent genome-wide studies. RRM1 acts as a main binding platform, including atypical extensions to the canonical RRM fold. RRM2 acts cooperatively with RRM1, capping the RNA using an unusual binding pocket, leading to an unusual mode of tandem RRM-RNA recognition. We show that the consensus motif is sufficient to mediate upregulation of a reporter gene in human cells and that this process depends not only on RNA binding by the RRMs, but also on DND1’s double-stranded RNA binding domain (dsRBD), which is dispensable for binding of a subset of targets in cellulo. Our results point to a model where DND1 target selection is mediated by a non-canonical mode of AU-rich RNA recognition by the tandem RRMs and a role for the dsRBD in the recruitment of effector complexes responsible for target regulation.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Nuclear depletion and cytoplasmic aggregation of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 are cellular hallmarks of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). TDP-43 nuclear loss causes de-repression of cryptic exons, yet cryptic alternative polyadenylation (APA) events have been largely overlooked. In this study, we developed a bioinformatic pipeline to reliably identify alternative last exons, 3’ untranslated region (3’UTR) extensions and intronic polyadenylation APA event types, and we identified cryptic APA sites induced by TDP-43 loss in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. TDP-43 binding sites are enriched at sites of these cryptic events, and TDP-43 can both repress and enhance APA. All categories of cryptic APA were also identified in ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) postmortem brain tissue. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), thiol(SH)-linked alkylation for the metabolic sequencing of RNA (SLAM-seq) and ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) revealed that distinct cryptic APA categories have different downstream effects on transcript levels and that cryptic 3’UTR extensions can increase RNA stability, leading to increased translation. In summary, we demonstrate that TDP-43 nuclear depletion induces cryptic APA, expanding the palette of known consequences of TDP-43.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Enterovirus 71 (EV71) poses serious threats to human health, particularly in Southeast Asia, and no drugs or vaccines are available. Previous work identified the stem loop II structure of the EV71 internal ribosomal entry site as vital to viral translation and a potential target. After screening an RNA-biased library using a peptide-displacement assay, we identify DMA-135 as a dose-dependent inhibitor of viral translation and replication with no significant toxicity in cell-based studies. Structural, biophysical, and biochemical characterization support an allosteric mechanism in which DMA-135 induces a conformational change in the RNA structure that stabilizes a ternary complex with the AUF1 protein, thus repressing translation. This mechanism is supported by pull-down experiments in cell culture. These detailed studies establish enterovirus RNA structures as promising drug targets while revealing an approach and mechanism of action that should be broadly applicable to functional RNA targeting.</p>},

   abstract = {<p> Selective pressures on viruses provide opportunities to establish target site specificity and mechanisms of antivirals. Enterovirus (EV)-A71 with resistant mutations in the stem loop (SL) II internal ribosome entry site (IRES) (SLII <sup>resist</sup> ) were selected at low doses of the antiviral dimethylamiloride (DMA)-135. The EV-A71 mutants were resistant to DMA-135 at concentrations that inhibit replication of wild-type virus. EV-A71 IRES structures harboring resistant mutations induced efficient expression of Luciferase messenger RNA in the presence of noncytotoxic doses of DMA-135. Nuclear magnetic resonance indicates that the mutations change the structure of SLII at the binding site of DMA-135 and at the surface recognized by the host protein AU-rich element/poly(U)-binding/degradation factor 1 (AUF1). Biophysical studies of complexes formed between AUF1, DMA-135, and either SLII or SLII <sup>resist</sup> show that DMA-135 stabilizes a ternary complex with AUF1-SLII but not AUF1-SLII <sup>resist</sup> . This work demonstrates how viral evolution elucidates the (DMA-135)–RNA binding site specificity in cells and provides insights into the viral pathways inhibited by the antiviral. </p>},

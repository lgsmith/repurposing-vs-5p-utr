   abstract = {<p>Dead End (DND1) is an RNA-binding protein essential for germline development through its role in post-transcriptional gene regulation. The molecular mechanisms behind selection and regulation of its targets are unknown. Here, we present the solution structure of DND1’s tandem RNA Recognition Motifs (RRMs) bound to AU-rich RNA. The structure reveals how an NYAYUNN element is specifically recognized, reconciling seemingly contradictory sequence motifs discovered in recent genome-wide studies. RRM1 acts as a main binding platform, including atypical extensions to the canonical RRM fold. RRM2 acts cooperatively with RRM1, capping the RNA using an unusual binding pocket, leading to an unusual mode of tandem RRM-RNA recognition. We show that the consensus motif is sufficient to mediate upregulation of a reporter gene in human cells and that this process depends not only on RNA binding by the RRMs, but also on DND1’s double-stranded RNA binding domain (dsRBD), which is dispensable for binding of a subset of targets in cellulo. Our results point to a model where DND1 target selection is mediated by a non-canonical mode of AU-rich RNA recognition by the tandem RRMs and a role for the dsRBD in the recruitment of effector complexes responsible for target regulation.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Nuclear depletion and cytoplasmic aggregation of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 are cellular hallmarks of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). TDP-43 nuclear loss causes de-repression of cryptic exons, yet cryptic alternative polyadenylation (APA) events have been largely overlooked. In this study, we developed a bioinformatic pipeline to reliably identify alternative last exons, 3’ untranslated region (3’UTR) extensions and intronic polyadenylation APA event types, and we identified cryptic APA sites induced by TDP-43 loss in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. TDP-43 binding sites are enriched at sites of these cryptic events, and TDP-43 can both repress and enhance APA. All categories of cryptic APA were also identified in ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) postmortem brain tissue. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), thiol(SH)-linked alkylation for the metabolic sequencing of RNA (SLAM-seq) and ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) revealed that distinct cryptic APA categories have different downstream effects on transcript levels and that cryptic 3’UTR extensions can increase RNA stability, leading to increased translation. In summary, we demonstrate that TDP-43 nuclear depletion induces cryptic APA, expanding the palette of known consequences of TDP-43.</p>},

Previous work identified the stem loop II structure of the EV71 internal ribosomal entry site as vital to viral translation and a potential target. After screening an RNA-biased library using a peptide-displacement assay, we identify DMA-135 as a dose-dependent inhibitor of viral translation and replication with no significant toxicity in cell-based studies. Structural, biophysical, and biochemical characterization support an allosteric mechanism in which DMA-135 induces a conformational change in the RNA structure that stabilizes a ternary complex with the AUF1 protein, thus repressing translation. This mechanism is supported by pull-down experiments in cell culture. These detailed studies establish enterovirus RNA structures as promising drug targets while revealing an approach and mechanism of action that should be broadly applicable to functional RNA targeting.</p>},

Enterovirus (EV)-A71 with resistant mutations in the stem loop (SL) II internal ribosome entry site (IRES) (SLII <sup>resist</sup> ) were selected at low doses of the antiviral dimethylamiloride (DMA)-135. The EV-A71 mutants were resistant to DMA-135 at concentrations that inhibit replication of wild-type virus. EV-A71 IRES structures harboring resistant mutations induced efficient expression of Luciferase messenger RNA in the presence of noncytotoxic doses of DMA-135. Nuclear magnetic resonance indicates that the mutations change the structure of SLII at the binding site of DMA-135 and at the surface recognized by the host protein AU-rich element/poly(U)-binding/degradation factor 1 (AUF1). Biophysical studies of complexes formed between AUF1, DMA-135, and either SLII or SLII <sup>resist</sup> show that DMA-135 stabilizes a ternary complex with AUF1-SLII but not AUF1-SLII <sup>resist</sup> .

  abstract = {Obtaining accurate binding free energies from in silico screens has been a long-standing goal for the computational chemistry community. However, accuracy and computational cost are at odds with one another, limiting the utility of methods that perform this type of calculation. Many methods achieve massive scale by explicitly or implicitly assuming that the target protein adopts a single structure, or undergoes limited fluctuations around that structure, to minimize computational cost. Others simulate each protein--ligand complex of interest, accepting lower throughput in exchange for better predictions of binding affinities. Here, we present the PopShift framework for accounting for the ensemble of structures a protein adopts and their relative probabilities. Protein degrees of freedom are enumerated once, and then arbitrarily many molecules can be screened against this ensemble. Specifically, we use Markov state models (MSMs) as a compressed representation of a protein's thermodynamic ensemble. We start with a ligand-free MSM and then calculate how addition of a ligand shifts the populations of each protein conformational state based on the strength of the interaction between that protein conformation and the ligand. In this work we use docking to estimate the affinity between a given protein structure and ligand, but any estimator of binding affinities could be used in the PopShift framework. We test PopShift on the classic benchmark pocket T4 Lysozyme L99A. We find that PopShift is more accurate than common strategies, such as docking to a single structure and traditional ensemble docking-producing results that compare favorably with alchemical binding free energy calculations in terms of RMSE but not correlation-and may have a more favorable computational cost profile in some applications. In addition to predicting binding free energies and ligand poses, PopShift also provides insight into how the probability of different protein structures is shifted upon addition of various concentrations of ligand, providing a platform for predicting affinities and allosteric effects of ligand binding. Therefore, we expect PopShift will be valuable for hit finding and for providing insight into phenomena like allostery.},

  abstract = {Introduction: HIV-1 uses a programmed --1 ribosomal frameshift to generate Gag-Pol, the precursor of its enzymes, when its full-length mRNA is translated by the ribosomes of the infected cells. This change in the reading frame occurs at a so-called slippery sequence that is followed by a specific secondary structure, the frameshift stimulatory signal. This signal controls the frameshift efficiency. The synthesis of HIV-1 enzymes is critical for virus replication and therefore, the --1 ribosomal frameshift could be the target of novel antiviral drugs. Areas covered: Various approaches were used to select drugs interfering with the --1 frameshift of HIV-1. These include the selection and modification of chemical compounds that specifically bind to the frameshift stimulatory signal, the use of antisense oligonucleotides targeting this signal and the selection of compounds that modulate HIV-1 frameshift, by using bicistronic reporters where the expression of the second cistron depends upon HIV-1 frameshift. Expert opinion: The most promising approach is the selection and modification of compounds specifically targeting the HIV-1 frameshift stimulatory signal. The use of antisense oligonucleotides binding to the frameshift stimulatory signal is still questionable. The use of bicistronic reporters preferentially selects compounds that modulate the frameshift by targeting the ribosomes, which is less promising.},

Many RNA-binding proteins possess multiple RNA-binding domains; however, how these domains interplay to select and regulate RNA targets remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate three multi-domain proteins, Musashi-1, Musashi-2, and unkempt, which share a high degree of RNA specificity, a common feature across RNA-binding proteins. We used massively parallel \emph{in vitro} assays with unprecedented depth with random or naturally-derived RNA sequences and find that individual domains within a protein can have differing affinities, specificities, and motif spacing preferences. We conducted large scale competition assays between these proteins and determined how individual protein specificities and affinities influence competitive binding. Integration of binding and regulation \emph{in cells} with \emph{in vitro} specificities showed that target selection involves a combination of the protein intrinsic specificities described here, but cellular context is critical to drive these proteins to motifs in specific transcript regions. Finally, evolutionarily conserved RNA regions displayed evidence of binding multiple RBPs \emph{in cultured cells}, and these RNA regions represent the highest affinity targets. This work emphasizes the importance of \emph{in vitro} and \emph{in cultured cells} studies to fully profile RNA-binding proteins and highlights the complex modes of RNA-protein interactions and the contributing factors in target selection.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Binding free energy calculations based on molecular simulations provide predicted affinities for biomolecular complexes.These calculations begin with a detailed description of a system, including its chemical composition and the interactions between its components.Simulations of the system are then used to compute thermodynamic information, such as binding affinities.Because of their growing promise for guiding molecular design, these calculations have recently begun to see widespread applications in early stage drug discovery.However, many challenges remain to make them a robust and reliable tool.\&nbsp;Here, we highlight key challenges facing these calculations, describe known examples of these challenges, and call for the designation of standard community benchmark test systems that will help the research community generate and evaluate progress.In our view, progress will require careful assessment and evaluation of new methods, force fields, and modeling innovations on well-characterized benchmark systems, and we lay out our vision for how this can be achieved.\&nbsp; \&nbsp;This repository relates to the perpetual review (definition) paper called "Predicting binding free energies: Frontiers and benchmarks" by David L.

  abstract = {Discoveries of RNA roles in cellular physiology and pathology are increasing the need for new tools that modulate the structure and function of these biomolecules, and small molecules are proving useful. In 2017, we curated the RNA-targeted BIoactive ligaNd Database (R-BIND) and discovered distinguishing physicochemical properties of RNA-targeting ligands, leading us to propose the existence of an ``RNA-privileged'' chemical space. Biennial updates of the database and the establishment of a website platform (rbind.chem.duke.edu) have provided new insights and tools to design small molecules based on the analyzed physicochemical and spatial properties. In this report and R-BIND 2.0 update, we refined the curation approach and ligand classification system as well as conducted analyses of RNA structure elements for the first time to identify new targeting strategies. Specifically, we curated and analyzed RNA target structural motifs to determine the properties of small molecules that may confer selectivity for distinct RNA secondary and tertiary structures. Additionally, we collected sequences of target structures and incorporated an RNA structure search algorithm into the website that outputs small molecules targeting similar motifs without a priori secondary structure knowledge. Cheminformatic analyses revealed that, despite the 50\% increase in small molecule library size, the distinguishing properties of R-BIND ligands remained significantly different from that of proteins and are therefore still relevant to RNA-targeted probe discovery. Combined, we expect these novel insights and website features to enable the rational design of RNA-targeted ligands and to serve as a resource and inspiration for a variety of scientists interested in RNA targeting.},

  abstract = {Recent breakthroughs in AI-mediated protein structure prediction have significantly accelerated research and generated valuable hypotheses within the field of structural biology and beyond. Notably, AlphaFold2 has facilitated the determination of larger protein complexes for which only limited experimental data are available. De novo predictions can now be experimentally validated with relative ease compared to the pre-AlphaFold2 era. In May 2024, AlphaFold3 was launched with high expectations, promising the capability to accurately predict RNA structures and protein-RNA complexes - features that were absent in AlphaFold2. This review evaluates the extent to which AlphaFold3 fulfills this promise through specific examples. At present, AlphaFold3 falls short in reliably predicting RNA and protein-RNA complex structures, particularly for non-canonical interactions where training data remain scarce. As a result, users should exercise caution when using AlphaFold3 predictions as hypotheses generators for RNA and protein-RNA complex structures. In the interim, integrating AI-based predictors with data-driven docking tools is recommended to address these limitations. This approach can help bridge the gap until sufficient training data are available to enable the development of more reliable predictive algorithms.},

From intracellular viral RNA-host interfaces to interactions between the RNA genome and structural proteins in virus particles themselves, almost the entire viral lifecycle is accompanied by a myriad of RNA--protein interactions that are required to fulfill their replicative potential. It is therefore important to characterize such rich and dynamic collections of viral RNA--protein interactions to understand virus evolution and their adaptation to their hosts and environment. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have allowed the characterization of viral RNA--protein interactions, including both transient and conserved interactions, where molecular and structural approaches have fallen short. In this review, we will provide a methodological overview of the high-throughput techniques used to study viral RNA--protein interactions, their biochemical mechanisms, and how they evolved from classical methods as well as one another. We will discuss how different techniques have fueled virus research to characterize how viral RNA and proteins interact, both locally and on a global scale. Finally, we will present examples on how these techniques influence the studies of clinically important pathogens such as HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {RNA motifs can be defined broadly as recurrent structural elements containing multiple intramolecular RNA--RNA interactions, as observed in atomic-resolution RNA structures. They constitute the modular building blocks of RNA architecture, which is organized hierarchically. Recent work has focused on analyzing RNA backbone conformations to identify, define and search for new instances of recurrent motifs in X-ray structures. One current view asserts that recurrent RNA strand segments with characteristic backbone configurations qualify as independent motifs. Other considerations indicate that, to characterize modular motifs, one must take into account the larger structural context of such strand segments. This follows the biologically relevant motivation, which is to identify RNA structural characteristics that are subject to sequence constraints and that thus relate RNA architectures to sequences.},

Here we introduce a new data set of RNA elements in the human genome that are recognized by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), generated as part of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project phase III. This class of regulatory elements functions only when transcribed into RNA, as they serve as the binding sites for RBPs that control post-transcriptional processes such as splicing, cleavage and polyadenylation, and the editing, localization, stability and translation of mRNAs. We describe the mapping and characterization of RNA elements recognized by a large collection of human RBPs in K562 and HepG2 cells. Integrative analyses using five assays identify RBP binding sites on RNA and chromatin in vivo, the in vitro binding preferences of RBPs, the function of RBP binding sites and the subcellular localization of RBPs, producing 1,223 replicated data sets for 356 RBPs. We describe the spectrum of RBP binding throughout the transcriptome and the connections between these interactions and various aspects of RNA biology, including RNA stability, splicing regulation and RNA localization. These data expand the catalogue of functional elements encoded in the human genome by the addition of a large set of elements that function at the RNA level by interacting with RBPs.},

Small-molecule (SM) targeting of RNA-protein complexes requires an infusion of innovation to accelerate the discovery of new modalities that illuminate biological mechanisms and hold therapeutic promise. RNA–protein (RNP) complexes orchestrate essential steps in gene expression under normal physiological and pathological conditions. However, despite decades of research and substantial financial and human investment, the repertoire of SM modulators of RNPs remains limited. To overcome this gap, the field requires complementary strategies that operate in parallel with sequencing-based approaches that map the RNA structure, RNA-binding protein (RBP) and SM occupancies.

Bridging the discovery gap will require integrative frameworks that combine structural prediction, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, and experimental workflows. Recent advances in structure prediction, exemplified by AlphaFold3, now enable modeling of RNP complexes that provide starting coordinates for biophysical and mechanistic interrogation.
